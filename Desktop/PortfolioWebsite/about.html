        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            Hello! I'm Maxx Parcesepe, a dedicated and dynamic Computer Science student at Florida Atlantic University, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree.
            My fascination with technology began during my high school years at Boca Raton Community High School, where I was drawn to coding languages such as C++, JavaScript, GitBash, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a child, my love for Formula One ignited a spark of curiosity and inspiration within me.
            Watching the precision, innovation, and speed of Formula One races fueled my imagination and sowed the seeds of my desire to contribute to the world of automotive technology.
            It was this childhood passion that laid the foundation for my journey into the field of Computer Science and my aspirations to make a mark in the world of electric vehicles.

        <p>
            What sets me apart is my ability to seamlessly juggle multiple responsibilities. While pursuing my education, I've been actively involved in real-world projects.
            Since August 2015, I've been a valued Contractors Assistant at Jamko Builders, where I've concurrently managed tasks ranging from painting, taping, and working with electrical circuits
            to contributing to the overall design and implementation of residential projects. This multifaceted experience has not only polished my technical skills but has also honed my knack for multitasking and problem-solving.

        <p>
            Simultaneously, from August 2019 to January 2020, I served as a College Algebra Tutor at Florida Atlantic University.
            This period allowed me to not only further deepen my understanding of mathematical concepts but also develop the skill of articulating complex topics in a simple and comprehensible manner.

            Combining my passion for technology and my childhood love for Formula One, I took a leadership role as the Vice President of Operations for FAU S.P.E.E.D. (Sustainable Power and Electric Education Development).
            In this position, I successfully led the creation of an electric race team, drawing inspiration from the innovation and speed of Formula One. This venture involved an intensive recruitment process to find fit students,
            designing an electric race car from scratch, and managing the engineering and design process. It was a dream come true, where my childhood fascination with racing technology met the present-day pursuit of sustainable solutions.

        <p>
            Beyond my technical skills, I am a dedicated and hardworking individual. This is evident in my role as the Vice President of Operations for FAU S.P.E.E.D., where I successfully led the creation of an electric race team.
            Managing the recruitment process, overseeing the design and engineering of an electric race car, setting clear goals and timelines, and maintaining a strong social media presence for the team required a relentless work ethic, which I bring to every project.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, I have cultivated my ability as a public speaker, regularly conducting meetings and presentations during my time as the Vice President of Operations for FAU S.P.E.E.D.
            This experience has refined my communication skills, allowing me to convey complex ideas with clarity and engage audiences effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am excited about the limitless potential of technology and am committed to making a positive impact through innovative solutions.
